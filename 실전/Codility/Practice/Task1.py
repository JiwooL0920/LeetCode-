# Write a function:

# def solution(A)

# that, given an array A of N integers, returns the smallest positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

# For example, given A = [1, 3, 6, 4, 1, 2], the function should return 5.

# Given A = [1, 2, 3], the function should return 4.

# Given A = [−1, −3], the function should return 1.

# Write an efficient algorithm for the following assumptions:

# N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
# each element of array A is an integer within the range [−1,000,000..1,000,000].

# you can write to stdout for debugging purposes, e.g.
# print("this is a debug message")

def solution(A):
    # write your code in Python 3.8.10
    s = set()
    res = 1

    for n in A:
        if n > 0:
            s.add(n)

    for n in range(1, len(A)+2):
        if n not in s:
            return n
    
    return 1
