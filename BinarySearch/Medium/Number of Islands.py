# Given a two-dimensional integer matrix of 1s and 0s, return the number of "islands" in the matrix. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water.

# Note: Neighbors can only be directly horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

# Constraints

# n, m â‰¤ 100 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix.
# Example 1
# Input
# matrix = [
#     [1, 1],
#     [1, 0]
# ]
# Output
# 1
# Example 2
# Input
# matrix = [
#     [1, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 1, 1, 0],
#     [0, 1, 1, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#     [1, 1, 0, 0, 1],
#     [1, 1, 0, 0, 1]
# ]
# Output
# 4
# Example 3
# Input
# matrix = [
#     [0, 1],
#     [1, 0]
# ]
# Output
# 2
