# You are given a two-dimensional integer matrix of 1s and 0s. A 1 represents land and 0 represents water, so an island is a group of 1s that are neighboring whose perimeter is surrounded by water. You can assume that the edges of the matrix are surrounded by water.

# Return the area of the largest island in matrix.

# Constraints

# n, m â‰¤ 250 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix
# Example 1
# Input
# matrix = [
#     [0, 0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 1],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 0],
#     [0, 0, 1, 1, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 1, 1],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
# ]
# Output
# 7
# Explanation
# The largest island in the center has an area of 7 units.
