# Given an 2D matrix of 0s and 1s, a 1 represents land and 0 represents water. An island is a group of 1's that are surrounded by 0s or by the border. Find all the islands that are completely surrounded by water and modify them into 0s.

# An island is completed surrounded by water if all of the neighbours are water (that is, none of the neighbours are borders).

# Note: Neighbours can only be directly horizontal or vertical, not diagonal.

# Constraints

# n, m â‰¤ 250 where n and m are the number of rows and columns in matrix

# Input
# board = [
#     [1, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 1, 1, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0]
# ]
# Output
# [
#     [1, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0],
#     [0, 0, 0, 0]
# ]
